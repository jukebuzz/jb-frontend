## About Jukebuzz

If you are a young and hot team under one roof it's very important that you haven't got any conflicts, especially 
because of the so stupid reason as music preferences. Our Jukebuzz service is like a jukebox for office use. Pay for 
you tracks with your work activity =) and listen for free legal music from Soundcloud.

Create own rooms, invite your teammates - coins will be collected automatically for free and for you work results 
(Github commit activities can be collected). Ð¡ollaborate with your teammates building collective playlist and listen 
it easily from one sound source. Showing crackerjack music visualization and track title with any projector on a wall 
will be a pleasant bonus.

## Architecture
